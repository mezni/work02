Build an Auth-Service microservice in Rust (1.90+) using Actix-Web, 
following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. 
The service must integrate with Keycloak for authentication and authorization. 
Only the Auth-Service should interact with Keycloak. 
All domain layers must remain pure and free of external dependencies (SQLx, Actix, Keycloak, HTTP, etc.).
The service will handle CRUD operations for users, with role-based access control.
Requirements:
1- Admin Users: are the users of the platform, 
- can  create other admins, give them role=admin
- can create users related to organisations, give them role=partner and organisation=organisation_name
- can list, update , soft delete , deactivate reactivate activate the users of the platform

2- Partner Users: are the users of their organisation, 
- can  create other users for their organisations, give them role=operator and organisation=organisation_name by its by default
- can list, update , soft delete , deactivate reactivate activate the users or teir organisation

i will have 2 microservices 
- auth-Service for auth and authorizati
- configurator-service where i can manage users , organisation 


Technical Requirements

- Keycloak will be used for authentication and authorization and token validation and refresh
- use sqlx (dynmic queries) and postgres, Use sqlx's dynamic queries 
- use keycloak = "26.4.0" library 
- error handling or logging requirements, use thiserror for error handling.
- use argon2 password hashing and verification
- add support to openspi utoipa  and utoipa-swagger-ui 
- for tracing use tracing-subscriber and tracing-actix-web 
- Introduce a Claims Value Object: Instead of passing raw JWT data, create a Domain-level struct Claims (or similar) that represents the authenticated user's 
context (user_id, roles, organization). This object is created in the Infrastructure/
- Use CQRS and Use Traits in the Application layer for UserRepository and AuthGateway. 
- use lib.rs and move app state and web server startup to it
- use cors 
- for swagger-ui protect endpoints with token
- add config reader 
- organisation is added to keycloak users as attribute of the users
- add lib.rs and move web server startup , application state, add cors 
- add sql migrations
- add read configurations 

is it clear? , what are your hypothesis ? have you any questions? what are your suggestions?
