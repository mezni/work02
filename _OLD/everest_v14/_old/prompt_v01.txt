Build an Auth-Service microservice in Rust (1.90+) using Actix-Web, 
following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. 
The service must integrate with Keycloak for authentication and authorization. 
Only the Auth-Service should interact with Keycloak. 
All domain layers must remain pure and free of external dependencies (SQLx, Actix, Keycloak, HTTP, etc.).
Requirements:
    User Types & Roles:
        Operator (belongs to exactly one Partner; scoping enforced)
        Partner (owns resources; can manage Operators)
        Admin (full system access)
    Identity & Access:
        Admin User Creation: Admin can create user accounts with roles: admin, partner, operator.
        Operator → Partner Link: Stored in Keycloak user attributes: organisation_name: "AcmeCorp"
Architecture & Layers
Domain Layer: Entities , value objects , repository traits, domain services, and errors (thiserror).
Application Layer: Commands, queries, DTOs, and handlers. DTOs must support Swagger/OpenAPI (utoipa).
Infrastructure Layer:
SQLx/Postgres repositories
Keycloak client for user creation, role assignment, and authentication
JWT token enricher with partner_name 
Configuration loader (.env)
Logging with tracing
Interfaces Layer:
HTTP routes and middleware
Swagger/OpenAPI integration with utoipa
Startup Layer:
Actix-Web server setup
Dependency injection for config and repositories
Routing, middleware, and Swagger UI
Roles
Admin: global access
Partner: organisation-level access
Operator: station-level access
Performance
~2000 users
~5 req/sec average
concurrency ~50 users
PostgreSQL DB with connection pooling
Deliverables
