Here's the updated prompt with public users and registered users removed:
Build an Auth-Service microservice in Rust (1.90+) using Actix-Web, following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. The service must integrate with Keycloak for authentication and authorization. Only the Auth-Service should interact with Keycloak. All domain layers must remain pure and free of external dependencies (SQLx, Actix, Keycloak, HTTP, etc.).
Requirements:
Architecture & Layers
Domain Layer: Entities (User, Organisation, Station), value objects (Email, Username), aggregates, repository traits, domain services, and errors (thiserror).
Application Layer: Commands, queries, DTOs, and handlers. DTOs must support Swagger/OpenAPI (utoipa).
Infrastructure Layer:
SQLx/Postgres repositories
Keycloak client for user creation, role assignment, and authentication
JWT token enricher with organisation_name and station_name
Configuration loader (.env)
Logging with tracing
Interfaces Layer:
HTTP routes and middleware
Swagger/OpenAPI integration with utoipa
Startup Layer:
Actix-Web server setup
Dependency injection for config and repositories
Routing, middleware, and Swagger UI
Endpoints
POST /auth/login → authenticate and return enriched JWT
POST /auth/admin/create-user → create admin, partner, or operator users
JWT Claims
{
"preferred_username": "username",
"role": "admin|partner|operator",
"organisation_name": "Org A or null",
"station_name": "Station X or null"
}
Roles
Admin: global access
Partner: organisation-level access
Operator: station-level access
Performance
~2000 users
~5 req/sec average
concurrency ~50 users
PostgreSQL DB with connection pooling
Deliverables
Full Rust project with Cargo.toml, lib.rs, main.rs
Fully structured DDD layers
SQLx migrations
Unit and integration tests
Swagger/OpenAPI ready endpoints
Logging and error handling
Instructions:
Generate the full folder structure and starter Rust code for each layer, including domain, 
application, infrastructure, interfaces, and startup. Include Swagger support, tracing logging, 
thiserror-based error handling, JWT enrichment, and Keycloak client.
